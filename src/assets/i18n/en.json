        "question_2": "CPR",
        "answer_2": "<b>CPR - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation </b> is a series of activities performed in a person suspected of having a sudden cardiac arrest.

        "question_4": "Defibrillation",
        "answer_4": "<b> Defibrillation </b> - a medical procedure used during resuscitation.
